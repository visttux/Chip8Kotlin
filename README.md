# Useful links I used to code this project
* [The wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) to know about chip-8 system
* This [article](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) was very usuful to learn how to start and how chip-8 works
* This [web](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) to learn what each instruction (opcode) should do
* This [chip-8 emulator coded in JS](https://rawgit.com/alexanderdickson/Chip-8-Emulator/master/index.html)Â to compare opcodes order with mine while debugging (to know if something went wrong)
